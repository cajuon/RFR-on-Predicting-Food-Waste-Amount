# Predicting Food Waste Amount using Random Forest Regressor
This repository made for showcasing the implementation of Random Forest Regressor on predicting the amount of food waste generated. 

## Overview
This repository showcases the implementation of a Random Forest Regressor model for predicting the amount of food waste generated. The project is part of a final year Computer Science project titled "Predicting Food Waste Generation Using Machine Learning."

## Model Evaluation
The implementation of the Random Forest Regression model will be evaluated using the following validation methods:

- Memory Recall
- Hold-out
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

## Technical Details
The project will be executed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

- Total Amount of Food Waste Annually in Malaysia (2009-2022)
