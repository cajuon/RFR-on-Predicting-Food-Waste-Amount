# RFR-on-Predicting-Food-Waste-Amount
This repository made for showcasing the implementation of Random Forest Regressor on predicting the amount of food waste generated. 

## Introduction
This project is a subpart of my Computer Science final year project, titled **"Predicting Food Waste Generation Using Machine Learning"**.

In exploring the machine learning models for the project, especially niching in on regression problems, it is found that Random Forest is one of the top algorithms in the list.

The implementation of Random Forest Regression model on the dataset will be further evaluated with selected validation method:
1. Memory recall
2. Hold-out
3. K-fold cross validation
4. Leave-One-Out cross validation

This project will be executed in python [Jupyter notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#:~:text=science.%5B8%5D-,Jupyter%20Notebook,-%5Bedit%5D).

## Dataset
The dataset were retrieved in the data collection stage earlier.

### 1. Total Amount of Food Waste Annually in Malaysia
This dataset containg the total amount of food waste annually from 2009 until 2022 in Malaysia.
